  <p>Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (/Ààz åk…ôrb…úÀêr…°/; born May 14, 1984), also known colloquially as Zuck, is an American business magnate, computer programmer, internet entrepreneur and philanthropist. He is known for co-founding the social media website Facebook and its parent company Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook, Inc.), of which he is the executive chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder.[1][2] <br>
    <br>
    Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. Originally launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users in 2012. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. He has used his funds to organize multiple philanthropic endeavors, including the establishment of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.</p>
